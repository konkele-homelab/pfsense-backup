# pfSense Backup Docker Container

This repository contains a minimal Docker image to automate **pfSense configuration backups** using a shell script. The container supports environment-based configuration, UID/GID assignment, Swarm secrets for credentials, SMTP notifications, and flexible retention policies.

---

## Features

- Back up multiple pfSense instances from a single container.
- Creates a **single timestamped snapshot directory per run** containing all host backups.
- Configurable backup directory and pluggable retention policies: **GFS, FIFO, Calendar**.
- Swarm secret support for storing credentials and SMTP secrets.
- Automatic pruning of old snapshots according to retention policy.
- XML validation to ensure backups are valid before retention is applied.
- Runs as non-root user with configurable UID/GID.
- Lightweight Alpine base image.

---

## Retention Policies

- **GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son)**: Retain daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Keep a fixed number of most recent snapshots.
- **Calendar**: Keep snapshots for a fixed number of days.

Retention behavior is controlled via environment variables and operates on **snapshot directories**, not individual files.

---

## Directory Layout

Backups are organized into timestamped snapshot directories:

```
/backup/
└── daily/
    ├── 2025-12-13_13-36-47/
    │   ├── pfsense1.example.com.xml
    │   └── pfsense2.example.com.xml
    ├── 2025-12-12_13-30-01/
    └── ...
└── weekly/
└── monthly/
└── latest -> daily/2025-12-13_13-36-47
```

- Each container run creates **one snapshot directory** shared by all hosts.
- Retention policies prune entire snapshot directories.
- The `latest` symlink always points to the most recent successful run.

## Swarm Secret Format

The servers file (typically stored as a Docker Swarm secret) must contain one host per line:

```
FQDN:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

Example:

```
pfsense.example.com:backupuser:securepass123
192.168.1.1:backupuser:anotherpass
```

> **Security Note**  
> The servers file contains plaintext credentials. Always store it as a Docker secret or restrict file permissions appropriately.

---

## Docker Compose Example (Swarm)

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  backup-pfsense:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/backup-pfsense:latest
    environment:
      BACKUP_DEST: /backup
      SERVERS_FILE: /run/secrets/backup-pfsense
      RETENTION_POLICY: gfs
      GFS_DAILY: 7
      GFS_WEEKLY: 4
      GFS_MONTHLY: 6
      EMAIL_ON_FAILURE: "true"
      EMAIL_TO: admin@example.com
      SMTP_SERVER: smtp.example.com
      TZ: America/Chicago
      USER_UID: 3000
      USER_GID: 3000
    volumes:
      - /backup:/backup
    secrets:
      - backup-pfsense
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: none

secrets:
  backup-pfsense:
    external: true
```

---

## Local Testing

To test without Swarm:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v /backup:/backup \
  -v ./servers:/config/servers \
  -e APP_BACKUP=/usr/local/bin/backup-pfsense.sh \
  -e RETENTION_POLICY=gfs \
  -e DRY_RUN=true \
  your-dockerhub-username/backup-pfsense:latest
```

Change `RETENTION_POLICY` to `fifo` or `calendar` to test other modes.

---

## Failure Semantics

- If **any host backup fails**, the application script exits non-zero.
- On failure:
  - The snapshot directory is preserved for inspection.
  - Retention policies are **not applied**.
  - Failure notifications are sent if enabled.

---

## Notes

- Backup files are validated to ensure they contain a valid `<pfsense>` XML root before being accepted.
- UID/GID customization ensures backup files match host filesystem ownership.
- Retention logic is implemented in `backup_common.sh` and shared across backup images.
- The container uses `su-exec` to drop privileges before running backups.
- Use `DRY_RUN=true` to safely test backup and retention behavior without modifying files.
